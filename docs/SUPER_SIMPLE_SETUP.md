# 🎯 Super Simple Setup (Google Drive Approach)

Your brilliant idea makes this MUCH simpler! Here's what you need to do:

## 🚀 Step 1: Set Up Google Drive Credentials Folder (5 minutes)

### 1.1 Create the Folder
1. **Go to your Google Drive**
2. **Create a new folder**: "Water Level Monitoring - Credentials"
3. **Upload your credential files**:
   - `water-levels-monitoring-451921-bfb891f4bf7c.json`
   - `client_secret_728293570565-45o222f786nahq6hc1o6vvi2kur6frvf.apps.googleusercontent.com.json`

### 1.2 Set Permissions
1. **Right-click the folder** → **Share**
2. **Add specific email addresses** of people you want to give access
3. **Set permission**: "Viewer" (they only need to download)
4. **Important**: Do NOT make it "Anyone with the link"

### 1.3 Get the Link
1. **Right-click the folder** → **Get link**
2. **Copy the link** - it looks like: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ABC123XYZ...`

## 🔧 Step 2: Update the App (2 minutes)

### 2.1 Update the Link in the App
Replace `YOUR_FOLDER_ID_HERE` with your folder ID in this file:
- `src/gui/dialogs/credentials_setup_dialog.py` (line 91)

The folder ID is the part after `/folders/` in your Google Drive link.

Example:
- **Link**: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ABC123XYZexample`
- **Folder ID**: `1ABC123XYZexample`

### 2.2 Update README
Replace `YOUR_FOLDER_ID_HERE` in:
- `README.md` (line 83)
- `docs/README_FOR_GITHUB.md` (line 83)

## 🧹 Step 3: Clean Up Repository (2 minutes)

### 3.1 Remove Exposed Credentials
```bash
git rm config/water-levels-monitoring-451921-bfb891f4bf7c.json
git rm config/client_secret_728293570565-45o222f786nahq6hc1o6vvi2kur6frvf.apps.googleusercontent.com.json
git commit -m "🔒 Move credentials to secure Google Drive folder"
git push origin main
```

### 3.2 Add .gitignore (already prepared)
```bash
cp docs/gitignore_template .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "🛡️ Add credential security protection"
git push origin main
```

## 🚀 Step 4: Create First Release (3 minutes)

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/benjaled/water_levels_monitoring_-for_external_edits-/releases
2. **Click**: "Create a new release"
3. **Fill in**:
   - **Tag**: `v1.0.0`
   - **Title**: `Water Level Monitoring System v1.0.0`
   - **Description**: Copy from `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.0.md`
4. **Publish**: Click "Publish release"
