# ðŸŽ¯ Simple Google Drive Credentials Setup

## Overview
Instead of complex private repositories, we use Google Drive itself to control access to the Google Drive credentials. Much simpler and more logical!

## ðŸš€ Setup Steps

### 1. Create Credentials Folder on Google Drive
1. **Create a folder** on your Google Drive called "Water Level Monitoring - Credentials"
2. **Upload your credential files**:
   - `water-levels-monitoring-451921-bfb891f4bf7c.json`
   - `client_secret_728293570565-45o222f786nahq6hc1o6vvi2kur6frvf.apps.googleusercontent.com.json`
3. **Set sharing permissions**:
   - Right-click folder â†’ Share
   - Add specific email addresses of authorized users
   - Set permission to "Viewer" (they only need to download)
   - **DO NOT** make it "Anyone with the link"

### 2. Get Shareable Link
1. **Right-click** the credentials folder
2. **Click "Get link"**
3. **Copy the link** (it will look like: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1abc123xyz...`)

### 3. Update Documentation
The link goes in your README and setup instructions for authorized users.
