# CAESER Water Levels Monitoring System

A comprehensive desktop application for water level data management and analysis. The system automatically imports Solinst XLE files, performs barometric pressure compensation, tracks transducer locations, and synchronizes data across multiple monitoring sites through Google Drive integration.

Built for groundwater professionals, researchers, and environmental consultants, this application streamlines the entire workflow from field data collection to analysis and reporting. Features include automated data processing, quality control algorithms, interactive visualizations, manual reading integration, and cloud-based collaboration tools for multi-user projects.
