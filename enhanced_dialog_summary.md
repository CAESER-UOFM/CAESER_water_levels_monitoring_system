# Enhanced Draft Selection Dialog

## ✅ PROBLEMS SOLVED

### 1. **Long Change Lists**
- **Before**: Changes displayed in full in dialog → dialog becomes huge
- **After**: 
  - Shows summary (first 200 characters)
  - Collapsible "View Changes Details" section
  - Scrollable text area for very long change lists
  - Fixed dialog width (600-800px)

### 2. **No Version Comparison**
- **Before**: User can't see if cloud changed since draft started
- **After**:
  - Shows draft creation time
  - Shows original cloud version (when draft started)
  - Shows current cloud version
  - **WARNING** if cloud version changed since draft
  - **✅ GOOD** if cloud unchanged

### 3. **Poor Layout for Complex Decisions**
- **Before**: Simple Yes/No dialog
- **After**:
  - Professional sectioned layout
  - Clear visual hierarchy
  - Color-coded options (green=draft, blue=cloud)
  - Detailed explanations for each choice

## 🎯 NEW DIALOG FEATURES

### **Header Section**
- 📝 Icon and "Local Draft Available" title
- Project name prominently displayed

### **Version Information Section**
```
📝 Your Draft:
• Created: 2025-06-27 16:42:16
• Based on cloud version: 2025-06-27 21:15:17 UTC

☁️ Current Cloud Version:
• Last modified: 2025-06-27 21:15:17 UTC

✅ Good: Cloud version unchanged since you started your draft.
```

### **Collapsible Changes Section**
- **▶ View Changes Details** (expandable)
- Summary: "Updated user flag for well TN157_000532; Updated user flag for well..."
- **Full details** in scrollable area if changes are long

### **Options Explanation**
```
📝 Continue with Draft (Recommended):
• Loads instantly (no download required)
• Preserves your unsaved changes
• Work offline and save locally
• Can upload to cloud later when ready

☁️ Download Fresh from Cloud:
• Downloads the latest version (slower)
• Your draft changes will be lost
• Gets any updates made by others
• Requires internet connection
```

### **Action Buttons**
- **📝 Continue with Draft** (green, prominent)
- **☁️ Download Fresh** (blue)
- **Cancel** (gray)

## 🧠 SMART LOGIC

### **Version Change Detection**
- Compares `original_download_time` from draft vs current cloud `modified_time`
- Shows warning if cloud version changed
- Helps user make informed decision

### **Change Length Handling**
- **Short changes** (< 200 chars): Show in summary
- **Long changes** (> 200 chars): Show summary + expandable details
- **Very long changes**: Scrollable text area

### **User Flow**
1. User tries to open cloud database
2. System detects existing draft
3. Shows enhanced dialog with all context
4. User makes informed choice:
   - **Draft**: Loads instantly, preserves work
   - **Cloud**: Downloads fresh, clears draft
   - **Cancel**: Returns to main window

## 🚀 TESTING

Run the app and go to **Cloud Database → CAESER_GENERAL**

You should see the new enhanced dialog with:
- ✅ Version comparison
- ✅ Collapsible change details  
- ✅ Clear options explanation
- ✅ Professional styling
- ✅ Fixed width (no overflow)

The dialog intelligently handles any length of changes and provides all the context needed for the user to make the right decision!
