PROBLEM: Method launcher shows "Well Unknown" instead of actual well names

POSSIBLE CAUSES:
1. Wells in the main interface have names set to "Unknown"
2. No wells are selected in the main interface before opening launcher
3. Well data format is not what's expected
4. Data manager is not providing well names correctly

SOLUTIONS TO TRY:

1. CHECK MAIN INTERFACE WELL SELECTION:
   - Make sure you have selected wells in the main 'Available Wells' table
   - Check that the selected wells have proper names (not "Unknown")
   - Try selecting different wells to see if the issue persists

2. CHECK WELL DATA IN MAIN INTERFACE:
   - Look at the main well table - do the wells have proper names there?
   - If wells show as "Unknown" in main interface, the problem is upstream
   - Check if well data was imported correctly

3. USE REFRESH BUTTON:
   - Click the "ðŸ”„ Refresh" button in the launcher
   - This will reload the well data

4. CHECK APPLICATION LOGS:
   - Look for detailed logging information about well processing
   - The logs will show exactly what data is being processed

5. FALLBACK - USE DATA MANAGER WELLS:
   - If no wells are selected, launcher tries to load all available wells
   - This may provide access to wells even if selection isn't working

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Wells should appear as "WellName (ID)" in the dropdown
- If well has no name, should appear as "Well ID"
- At least one well should be available for method testing

If none of these solutions work, there may be a deeper issue with well data
loading in the main application that needs to be addressed.
