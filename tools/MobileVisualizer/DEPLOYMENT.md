# Deployment Guide - Water Level Visualizer

## üöÄ Deploying to Netlify

This guide walks you through deploying the Water Level Visualizer mobile app to your Netlify account.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:
- A [Netlify](https://netlify.com) account
- Node.js 18+ installed locally
- Netlify CLI installed: `npm install -g netlify-cli`

## Quick Deploy with Netlify CLI (Recommended)

### Step 1: Login to Netlify
```bash
netlify login
```
This will open your browser to authenticate with your Netlify account.

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project
```bash
cd tools/MobileVisualizer
```

### Step 3: Initialize the Site
```bash
netlify init
```
Follow the prompts to create a new site or link to an existing one.

### Step 4: Deploy
```bash
netlify deploy --build --prod
```

Your app will be deployed and you'll get a live URL! üéâ

## Alternative: Git Integration

1. **Push to Git Repository**
   ```bash
   # If not already done, initialize git and push to your repository
   cd tools/MobileVisualizer
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add water level visualizer mobile app"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Netlify**
   - Log into your [Netlify dashboard](https://app.netlify.com)
   - Click "Add new site" ‚Üí "Import an existing project"
   - Choose your Git provider (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket)
   - Select your repository containing the water level monitoring code
   - Set the base directory to: `tools/MobileVisualizer`

3. **Configure Build Settings**
   ```
   Base directory: tools/MobileVisualizer
   Build command: npm run build
   Publish directory: tools/MobileVisualizer/.next
   ```

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Netlify will automatically build and deploy your app
   - You'll get a random URL like `https://amazing-name-123456.netlify.app`

### Option 2: Manual Upload

If you prefer to build locally and upload:

1. **Build the App**
   ```bash
   cd tools/Visualizer
   npm install
   npm run deploy
   ```

2. **Upload to Netlify**
   - In Netlify dashboard, drag and drop the `out` folder to deploy
   - Or use Netlify CLI: `netlify deploy --prod --dir=out`

## üì± Mobile Optimization Features

The app includes several mobile optimizations:

### **Touch Interface**
- 44px minimum touch targets
- Touch-friendly dropdowns and menus
- Gesture-based chart interactions (pan, zoom, tap)
- Optimized button spacing and sizing

### **Responsive Design**
- Mobile-first CSS with Tailwind breakpoints
- Adaptive layouts for phone/tablet/desktop
- Collapsible navigation and controls
- Touch-optimized data tables

### **Performance**
- Lazy loading of chart components
- Data downsampling for large datasets
- Efficient caching strategies
- Optimized bundle sizes

### **Offline Capability**
- Local database storage using IndexedDB/localStorage
- Service worker for caching (ready for PWA upgrade)
- Offline-first data access

## üîß Configuration Options

### Environment Variables (Optional)

You can set these in Netlify's environment variables section:

```env
# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME="Water Level Visualizer"
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAX_FILE_SIZE="104857600"  # 100MB

# Analytics (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID="your-google-analytics-id"

# Custom Branding (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ORGANIZATION_NAME="Your Organization"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL="support@yourorg.com"
```

### Custom Domain (Optional)

1. In Netlify dashboard, go to "Site settings" ‚Üí "Domain management"
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Follow instructions to configure DNS
4. Netlify will automatically provision SSL certificate

## üìä Post-Deployment

### Testing Your Deployment

1. **Basic Functionality**
   - Upload a test database file
   - Browse wells and view data
   - Test chart interactions on mobile device
   - Try export functionality

2. **Mobile Testing**
   - Test on actual mobile devices
   - Check touch interactions work properly
   - Verify responsive design at different screen sizes
   - Test file upload on mobile browsers

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Use browser dev tools to check loading times
   - Test with large database files
   - Verify memory usage stays reasonable

### Monitoring

- Monitor site analytics in Netlify dashboard
- Check error logs in "Functions" ‚Üí "Function logs"
- Use browser console to debug any client-side issues

## üîí Security Considerations

The app includes several security headers (configured in `netlify.toml`):
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`  
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

All processing happens client-side - no data is sent to servers.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Fails**
- Check that Node.js version is 18+
- Verify all dependencies are in package.json
- Check build logs in Netlify dashboard

**App Won't Load**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify sql.js WASM files are loading correctly
- Try clearing browser cache

**File Upload Issues**
- Check file size limits (100MB default)
- Verify file is valid SQLite database
- Test with different browsers

**Charts Not Rendering**
- Check if device supports WebGL
- Try reducing data points in large datasets
- Verify Recharts is loading properly

### Getting Help

1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Review Netlify build logs
3. Test locally with `npm run dev` to isolate issues
4. Check GitHub issues for similar problems

## üöÄ Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. **Share the URL** with your team
2. **Add to mobile home screens** for app-like experience
3. **Consider PWA features** for offline capabilities
4. **Monitor usage** and gather feedback
5. **Plan updates** based on user needs
